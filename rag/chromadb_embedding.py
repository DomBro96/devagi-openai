 1. Llama 2, an updated version of Llama 1, trained on a new mix of publicly available data. We also increased the size of the pretraining corpus by 40%, doubled the context length of the model, and adopted grouped-query attention (Ainslie et al., 2023). We are releasing variants of Llama 2 with 7B, 13B, and 70B parameters. We have also trained 34B variants, which we report on in this paper but are not releasing.§

 In this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a family of pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs, Llama 2 and Llama 2-Chat, at scales up to 70B parameters. On the series of helpfulness and safety benchmarks we tested, Llama 2-Chat models generally perform better than existing open-source models. They also appear to be on par with some of the closed-source models, at least on the human evaluations we performed (see Figures 1 and 3). We have taken measures to increase the safety of these models, using safety-specific data annotation and tuning, as well as conducting red-teaming and employing iterative evaluations. Additionally, this paper contributes a thorough description of our fine-tuning methodology and approach to improving LLM safety. We hope that this openness will enable the community to reproduce fine-tuned LLMs and continue to improve the safety of those models, paving the way for more responsible development of LLMs. We also share novel observations we made during the development of Llama 2 and Llama 2-Chat, such as the emergence of tool usage and temporal organization of knowledge.
